## Note:

### What is Encapsulation_and_AccessModifier?

Encapsulation means to hide data. It protects your classes from accidental changes or deletions and promotes code reusability and maintainability. 

We can secure and hide data of our variable by using this concept. There are 3 types of Access Modifier.

1. Public Variable  -->  It can be accessed by any class and object.
2. Protected Variable  -->  This variable can be accessed by parent and child class.
3. Private Variable  --> This variable cannot be accessed or modified outside the class. It can be accessed only by parent class.
